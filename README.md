# K_Nearest_Neighbors_Project
Fundamental Machine Learning techniques are applied to anonymized classification data with the purpose to build a model which will be able to predict the target class.    We will fit a K Nearest Neighbors model to the data using the Scikit-learn library.  A for loop is used to determine the errors on various KNN models to determine which k-value gives us the best model.  The data used was made up using other sources.  This project was done through Jose Portilla (head of Data Science at Pierian Data Inc.) on Udemy (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp).
